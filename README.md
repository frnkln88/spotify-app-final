## Final Project
# Good Vibes Only: A Spotify Playlist Streamer

Good Vibes Only is a Spotify streaming app that is centered around the playlists that users have curated. It allows users to play music exclusively through their own playlists, thus giving each user a personalized listening experience that does not introduce any music that the user isn't already familiar with.

# User Stories

A User should be able to:

- Login to the application using their Spotify account
- Logout using the button in the top left corner, which redirects the user to the login page
- In the sidebar, see a list of all playlists that the user has created, or added to their library
- View the user's profile picture and name in the top right corner
- View the corresponding tracklist when the playlist is clicked on
- Play any track by clicking on it
- Pause the track by clicking the "pause" button, and resume playback by clicking the "play" button
- View the currently playing track's name, artist, and album image in the Player component
- Adjust the volume of playback by using the slider or the buttons.
